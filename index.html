        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>Conditional Statements are used to execute tasks based on if their conditions have been met.
            The statements we learned were if, else, else if, and switch; each having their own uses.
            <ul>
                <li>if: executes if it's specified conditions are met</li>
                <li>else: executes if the initial if statement does not have it's conditions met</li>
                <li>else if: changes the flow to check if another statement's conditions are met, if the previous statement's conditions are not met</li>
                <li>switch: checks multiple statements to see if they are true, and will likely need to use the break command to not return multiple results.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
